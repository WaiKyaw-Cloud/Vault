```jsx
terraform plan -var-file tf-hcp-credentials.tfvars
```

- Find the HCP Vaulet Provider ([Page](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/hcp/latest/docs/resources/vault_cluster))
- Before creating the HCP Vault cluster, we must add the HashiCorp Virtual Networks (HVN) code into our Terraform code
- Save the client ID and secret as the environment variables HCP_CLIENT_ID and HCP_CLIENT_SECRET.

```jsx
// Credentials can be set explicitly or via the environment variables HCP_CLIENT_ID and HCP_CLIENT_SECRET
provider "hcp" {
  client_id     = "service-principal-key-client-id"
  client_secret = "service-principal-key-client-secret"
}
```

- Or, configure the provider with the client ID and secret by copy-pasting the values directly into provider config.

```jsx
HCP_CLIENT_ID="..."
HCP_CLIENT_SECRET="..."
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Warning:**Â Hard-coded credentials are not recommended in Terraform configuration outside of local testing and risks secret exposure if committed to a code repository.

## Create HVN step

- Sample code reference ([Page](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/hcp/latest/docs/resources/hvn))
- The following are default CIDR block values to be aware of: HCP HVN (172.25.16.0/20), AWS VPC (172.31.0.0/16), and Azure VNet (172.29.0.0/24).

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
